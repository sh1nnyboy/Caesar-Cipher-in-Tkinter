# Caesar Cipher in Tkinter

A simple desktop application built with Python and Tkinter that implements the Caesar Cipher encryption technique.

## Features

- Encrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm
- Customize the shift value (1-25)
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Preserves spaces and special characters

## What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Steps

```
git clone https://github.com/sh1nnyboy/Caesar-Cipher-in-Tkinter.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd Caesar-Cipher-in-Tkinter
```

3. Run the application:
```
python caesar_cipher.py
```

## Usage

1. Enter the text you want to encrypt in the "Plain Text" field
2. Set your desired shift value (1-25)
3. Click the "Encrypt!" button
4. View the encrypted result at the bottom of the application
